# ForzaNet
Creating a neural net to play Forza better than me (shouldn't be that hard)

## Setup
```conda activate tensorflow_ARM```

### Special Thanks

Much inspiration for the initial monitoring the game comes from this guide: https://medium.com/@sanilkhurana7/making-a-neural-network-learn-to-play-a-game-part-3-actually-coding-the-neural-network-16760f87dc09
